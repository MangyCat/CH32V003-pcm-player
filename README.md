# CH32V003-pcm-player
Plays an pcm audio file on the CH32V003 microcontroller
Materials needed:
* Piezo buzzer or speaker on the D5 pin , Piezo needs an membrane attached to it to make louder sounds
* An CH32V003 microcontroller (I used the J4M6 version thats 8 pinned)

When programming the CH32V003, remove the piezo/speaker or it'll refuse to program.
I programmed the ch32v003 using https://github.com/AlexanderMandera/arduino-wch32v003 and an minichlink programmer from https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun
